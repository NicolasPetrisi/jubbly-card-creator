<!--

HERE is where the action starts

Data from your csv can be access via card.header_name
The headers are transformed to a "slugged" format, so it is all
lower case, and spaces are replaced with "_"

For example, "Enchanted Monkey" would become "enchanted_monkey"
and would be accessed like "card.enchanted_monkey"

Leave the class='card' for automagic default styling for print etc.
It's a good idea to leave the :id and :key as well :)

 -->
<div
    class="card"
    :id="`card-${card.id}-${card._index}`"
    :key="`card-${card.id}-${card._index}`"
>
    <div class="print-area"> <!-- keep this print area to have magic bleed settings -->
        <h1 x-text="card.name"></h1>
    </div>
</div>
